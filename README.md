This is a fork of the [Scriptor theme for Jekyll](https://github.com/JustGoodThemes/Scriptor-Jekyll-Theme) by [Just Good Themes](https://github.com/JustGoodThemes/Scriptor-Jekyll-Theme).

It's only really intended for use on [my personal website](https://iterative.co.nz).

I have pulled out things like comments and social media integration and simplified some of the templates.
